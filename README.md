# Change-MacAddress-Light

# Overview

This is a free open source software (coded in C#). The author was inspired by the commercial version of LizardSystem. 
The author recommends the purchase of the full version at the following link: https://lizardsystems.com/change-mac-address/ and assumes no responsibility for the misuse of the software itself.
# How it works
This tool has been designed in case you need to change the physical address of the network cards 
(LAN and Wireless) especially when you want to bypass a problem with the router or merge a host name in an Active Directory domain.
